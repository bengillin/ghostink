# GhostInk

> A living notebook for lyricists, where every keystroke is sacred and the spirits of the greats write alongside you.

**GhostInk** is a version-controlled creative writing environment for songwriters, focused on rap and lyric writing. AI collaborators called **Masks** — trained on specific artists' bodies of work — write alongside you while maintaining crystal-clear attribution.

## The Vision

- **Every edit tracked**: Character-by-character history of how your verse evolved
- **Masks**: AI artist models (starting with MF DOOM) that complete lines, suggest rhymes, and collaborate
- **Rhymebook**: Integrated rhyme finder with slant rhymes, multis, internal rhymes, and phonetic matching
- **Attribution**: Always know what came from you vs. the machine

## Status

Early development. See [docs/VISION.md](docs/VISION.md) for the full design document.
